                Since the interpreter is written and working properly with exit functions, it's time for a
                more mathematical approach. In this article, I discuss how to determine instruction keywords using decimal values to deduce ASCII character strings.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                I remove all signaled ("") character logic checks, and replace methods with decimal counters. The computer needs to take an input, then it
                has to insert the string into memory. The most crucial part to this is that the writer must replace all visual characters with decimal counterparts.
                In so doing, all letters can be added as numbers. At this stage, a paragraph can be represented as a sum. With this sum, you can subtract user definitions,
                AKA instructions; to get whether a sentence exists, and whether that sentence makes any sense.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                It's really that simple. If you look at the images, you can see that all that is left to do is define your own instructions by declaring key value pair
                dictionaries. For example, 619 = the sentence "To blue". From here, you can do whatever you want. You just need to implement methods to check for character
                ordering for some fringe use cases where properly arranged sentences might add up to the same number. Be sure to stay tuned for more information.

            <h3><u class="Index">Lexer improvements (part 2)</u></h3>
            <p>
                <time class="Dated" datetime="2021-01-13" title="2021-01-13" style="font-size: .66rem; padding: 3px;"><i>January 13, 2021</i></time>

            <p>
                I saw someone entered a command ",Get resume.". It caused the lexical analyzer to fail!
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                What did I do to fix it? It took some thinking, especially since this lexer is a pre-dated version. There's just so much to do and I have to be smart
                with my focus; so the fix was this; add emergency exits, and provide the lexer with a "smart" detection system.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                By using decimal values instead of ASCII visual characters, the lexer now just checks if the number is equal to a letter representation, and if it does
                tries to read it. There is a lookahead to take into account, which causes this thing to be a very powerful switch mechanism. It does an awesome job at deducing
                instructions regardless of their order, and terminating; but it doesn't do as well of a job at "being humanized", so if it doesn't find something it knows, it gets
                caught in a forever loop. The fix to that, is to program it to always quit if it ever gets caught, or "confused". Now it's just about 100% reliable.
            </p> <br />

                I wanted to provide an example of a procedurally programmed language like the one I first began in C. I wrote it in
                JavaScript to complement my website, and it branched into many outstanding new ideas and features.

            <p>
                I have moved on from this and now program in class based JavaScript or C#. I do not know if I intend to do a full write up on this type of programming

            <p>
                I have a ton of experience with sound design and software synthesis, and I hold electronic sound
                development dear to my heart. When I realized I was a good enough programmer to create my own
                synthesizer I became very enthusiastic about it, and got straight into it.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                I just want to point out that this takes a significant amount of scientific clearance with regards to
                how much effort you are going to have to put into generating arrays for wave design. Even with 9 years
                sound production and nerding out over bit depths and all other sorts of dithering techniques, I still found
                this to be quite a struggle, as most people would agree who have gone down such a path. It's hard stuff!
                Trigonometry wasn't something I had experience with yet, so I had to teach myself! Was definitely worth it
                though... So let's get started shall we?
            </p> <br />

            <h3 id="Synth1WaveExplanation">Trigonometry for sound (part 1)</h3>

            <p>
                You have to initialize a sample rate. If you don't get this already, please take some time off and go study it.
                None of it is going to click if you don't already have experience with some sort of bit rate, or hertz generation
                calculation technique. These same techniques are also involved in booting an OS. If you want some help with that, try
                my OS discussion. It all adds up.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                A sample rate is a certain number that fits inside of a calculation which is to be divided or iterated upon over time.
                In this case, it is used to determine how many bytes are neccessary to find a hz frequency over 1 second of time.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                For a trigonometry buff, I would liken to the total count of cosine, tangent, or sine theta/hypotenuse calculations
                that you need.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                A loop is formed to count each sample. This is called the index, or in my case, I chose to call it the "position".
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                As the index is iterated, you determine the wave position by multiplying the maximum value held in your datatype.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                To generate a wave you need to calculate a circle. A diameter is found using the formula 2pi * r. To determine the xy
                position, you use the formula for sin, which is the opposite / hypotenuse. Or in this case,
                sin (diameter determined by frequency / sample rate). This ratio is constant until the wave is finished! So, that means;
                every position you use to multiply by the ratio of its sin theta value, you get the full circle. Then you amplify it by
                its maximum allotted space as a datatype.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                This is an extremely important thing to note about how this works. Please pay close attention to this.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                Given all that information it is correct to assume that something can't be right. If you were to multiply by the max
                allowed space in a datatype, obviously that would mean you'd exceed it, correct? Exactly. Except, a sample rate was defined
                earlier. This means that everytime the frequency is included, the overall ratio is reduced. Since position in every theta
                calculation is included; the total amplitude always changes. Thus every resulting value is less than the ratio of 1, therefore;
                every multiplication onto the datatype is going to be less than its limitation.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                The final calculation should make more sense now. sin (diameter determined by frequency / (sample rate * position)) just means
                that you are increasing the length of the hypotenuse represented by its position in time, which results in a changing ratio to be
                multiplied by its limitation.
            </p> <br />

            </p>

            <p>
                The array that has been calculated hosts a wave represenatation. It can either be plotted or block copied onto a sound player class/buffer.

                This section is more involved than booting a computer. First, define a string that is empty.
                Use this to begin passing bytes to from int 22 (hex 0x16). On each interrupt, the computer
                holds the key value in al, as per the 00h service (0) specified in ah. al is where the result is
                placed. This continues to return and allow user input [makes an array of ASCII decimals],
                when enter is found, it is not added to the string. After a comparison to hex 0xd is flagged
                true, the instruction pointer "jumps" to a code section defined by the writer, and restores the string
                to si to reset its index. Then, the computer compares the first character in its input string
                to the options that it sees. When it finds an option in memory that matches, it jumps to the code block with which it represents.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                <a href="../DisplayMedia/ConvertingBinary1.png" target="_blank">
                    <img class="ArticleImages" src="../DisplayMedia/ConvertingBinary1.png" alt="For some reason, your browser did not load this image." />
                </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                A few new lines are printed using interrupt 0x10 (decimal 16),
                and a prompt is made one last time for input. This happens smoothly, and the prompt isn't
                really seen. A predefined string of 8 bytes is now loaded into si. Each
                byte has a decimal value of 48 (character "0"). This is for representing 1 bit.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                The value in al is used as an argument in the binary converter. Index zero is always loaded a value of 48.
                A comparison is made against 127 in al, which is the upper ASCII limit. Technically the value is 128 or 2 to the seventh power,
                except the comparison like that isn't possible, as the decimal visual representation doesn't exist. ASCII only reaches 127.
                If the value is greater, the program exits, because that means there was an error, or some form of an overflow. If the flag
                from the comparison is zero, the pointer jumps to the Zero label and the instruction exits.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                <a href="../DisplayMedia/ConvertingBinary2.png" target="_blank">

            </p>

            <p>
                The index is incremented by one, and the process begins again. This time it uses 64; or 2 to
                the power of 6. Each time this occurs, and the value in al is greater than or equal to the
                calculation of an exponent from base 2, that value gets subtracted from the present value in al. If
                it's greater, a 1 is loaded into the location which the si register points to on the string.
                From there, the pointer moves on and checks whether it is greater than each of the factors, writing
                either a 1 or a 0 into the byte array that is defined by the string. Finally it reaches the
                zeroth power, and it exits.

                Writing a Kernel is extremely simple. Finding out how to do it, well that's another story.
                There aren't a lot of guides out there doing this in assembly. You have to know where to look.

                This is how I found out how to jump out of the bootSector and into a Kernel. You just set everything
                up like I put in the pictures. Each label denotes a sector read from the disk. If you google the interrupt
                you can find out what each section represents.

            <h3>Getting into sectors from a bootLoader</h3>
            <p>
                This part is also easy. It's just not well known. The answer is very minimal.
                Each binary file must be loaded onto the computers drive in order.
                That makes sectors accessible by the read interrupt. Do this by concatenating the binary files into a
                single .bin. Here is an example of a make file in Linux to do this in one Linux terminal line.

            <h3>Kernel jump.</h3>
            <p>
                At this point, just jump to the address in RAM where
                the kernel was loaded to. Once you get there, you can use the 0x7c00 origin address to get back, but
                you usually don't need to unless there is a reason for a warm reset.
