            <p>
                This section is more involved than booting a computer. First, define a string that is empty.
                Use this to begin passing bytes to from int 22 (hex 0x16). On each interrupt, the computer
                holds the key value in al, as per the 00h service (0) specified in ah. al is where the result is
                placed. This continues to return and allow user input [makes an array of ASCII decimals],
                when enter is found, it is not added to the string. After a comparison to hex 0xd is flagged
                true, the instruction pointer "jumps" to a code section defined by the writer, and restores the string
                to si to reset its index. Then, the computer compares the first character in its input string
                to the options that it sees. When it finds an option in memory that matches, it jumps to the code block with which it represents.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                <a href="../DisplayMedia/ConvertingBinary1.png" target="_blank">
                    <img class="ArticleImages" src="../DisplayMedia/ConvertingBinary1.png" alt="For some reason, your browser did not load this image." />
                </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                A few new lines are printed using interrupt 0x10 (decimal 16),
                and a prompt is made one last time for input. This happens smoothly, and the prompt isn't
                really seen. A predefined string of 8 bytes is now loaded into si. Each
                byte has a decimal value of 48 (character "0"). This is for representing 1 bit.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                The value in al is used as an argument in the binary converter. Index zero is always loaded a value of 48.
                A comparison is made against 127 in al, which is the upper ASCII limit. Technically the value is 128 or 2 to the seventh power,
                except the comparison like that isn't possible, as the decimal visual representation doesn't exist. ASCII only reaches 127.
                If the value is greater, the program exits, because that means there was an error, or some form of an overflow. If the flag
                from the comparison is zero, the pointer jumps to the Zero label and the instruction exits.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                <a href="../DisplayMedia/ConvertingBinary2.png" target="_blank">
                    <img class="ArticleImages" src="../DisplayMedia/ConvertingBinary2.png" alt="For some reason, your browser did not load this image." />
                </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The index is incremented by one, and the process begins again. This time it uses 64; or 2 to
                the power of 6. Each time this occurs, and the value in al is greater than or equal to the
                calculation of an exponent from base 2, that value gets subtracted from the present value in al. If
                it's greater, a 1 is loaded into the location which the si register points to on the string.
                From there, the pointer moves on and checks whether it is greater than each of the factors, writing
                either a 1 or a 0 into the byte array that is defined by the string. Finally it reaches the
                zeroth power, and it exits.

            </p>

            <p>
                Writing a Kernel is extremely simple. Finding out how to do it, well that's another story.
                There aren't a lot of guides out there doing this in assembly. You have to know where to look.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                This is how I found out how to jump out of the bootSector and into a Kernel. You just set everything
                up like I put in the pictures. Each label denotes a sector read from the disk. If you google the interrupt
                you can find out what each section represents.
            </p> <br />

            <h3>Getting into sectors from a bootLoader</h3>
            <p>
                This part is also easy. It's just not well known. The answer is very minimal.
                Each binary file must be loaded onto the computers drive in order.
                That makes sectors accessible by the read interrupt. Do this by concatenating the binary files into a
                single .bin. Here is an example of a make file in Linux to do this in one Linux terminal line.
            </p> <br />

            </p>

            <h3>Kernel jump.</h3>
            <p>
                At this point, just jump to the address in RAM where
                the kernel was loaded to. Once you get there, you can use the 0x7c00 origin address to get back, but
                you usually don't need to unless there is a reason for a warm reset.
