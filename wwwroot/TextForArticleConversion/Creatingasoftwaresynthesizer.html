            <p>
                I have a ton of experience with sound design and software synthesis, and I hold electronic sound
                development dear to my heart. When I realized I was a good enough programmer to create my own
                synthesizer I became very enthusiastic about it, and got straight into it.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                I just want to point out that this takes a significant amount of scientific clearance with regards to
                how much effort you are going to have to put into generating arrays for wave design. Even with 9 years
                sound production and nerding out over bit depths and all other sorts of dithering techniques, I still found
                this to be quite a struggle, as most people would agree who have gone down such a path. It's hard stuff!
                Trigonometry wasn't something I had experience with yet, so I had to teach myself! Was definitely worth it
                though... So let's get started shall we?
            </p> <br />

            <h3 id="Synth1WaveExplanation">Trigonometry for sound (part 1)</h3>

            <p>
                You have to initialize a sample rate. If you don't get this already, please take some time off and go study it.
                None of it is going to click if you don't already have experience with some sort of bit rate, or hertz generation
                calculation technique. These same techniques are also involved in booting an OS. If you want some help with that, try
                my OS discussion. It all adds up.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                A sample rate is a certain number that fits inside of a calculation which is to be divided or iterated upon over time.
                In this case, it is used to determine how many bytes are neccessary to find a hz frequency over 1 second of time.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                For a trigonometry buff, I would liken to the total count of cosine, tangent, or sine theta/hypotenuse calculations
                that you need.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                A loop is formed to count each sample. This is called the index, or in my case, I chose to call it the "position".
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                As the index is iterated, you determine the wave position by multiplying the maximum value held in your datatype.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                To generate a wave you need to calculate a circle. A diameter is found using the formula 2pi * r. To determine the xy
                position, you use the formula for sin, which is the opposite / hypotenuse. Or in this case,
                sin (diameter determined by frequency / sample rate). This ratio is constant until the wave is finished! So, that means;
                every position you use to multiply by the ratio of its sin theta value, you get the full circle. Then you amplify it by
                its maximum allotted space as a datatype.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                This is an extremely important thing to note about how this works. Please pay close attention to this.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                Given all that information it is correct to assume that something can't be right. If you were to multiply by the max
                allowed space in a datatype, obviously that would mean you'd exceed it, correct? Exactly. Except, a sample rate was defined
                earlier. This means that everytime the frequency is included, the overall ratio is reduced. Since position in every theta
                calculation is included; the total amplitude always changes. Thus every resulting value is less than the ratio of 1, therefore;
                every multiplication onto the datatype is going to be less than its limitation.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                The final calculation should make more sense now. sin (diameter determined by frequency / (sample rate * position)) just means
                that you are increasing the length of the hypotenuse represented by its position in time, which results in a changing ratio to be
                multiplied by its limitation.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                The array that has been calculated hosts a wave represenatation. It can either be plotted or block copied onto a sound player class/buffer.
